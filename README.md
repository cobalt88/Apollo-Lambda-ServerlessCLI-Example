# Graph Endpoint with Serverless CLI, Apolo Server, and AWS Lambda

documentation on how to set one of these up comming soon

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To replicate this type of endpoing you will need to have serverless cli installed (globally is best)

```
npm install -g serverless
```

and it will require you to the AWS CLI 2 installed and configured

[AWS CLI Configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html#cli-configure-quickstart-config)

after those 2 are installed and setup, download this repo as a .zip - initilize a new repository for your endpoint - and finally run 
```
serverless deploy
```
